                <p>
                    It's a silly question, but almost everyone doesn't do it.<br>
                    The minimum you should sleep is 6 hours, but you really need 8 for gains (or higher).<br>
                    If you don't have enough time to sleep, you're probably lying to yourself or you need to do less stuff.<br>
                    Not only does more sleep give gains, but it also just supports your life in general.

                    You should research this yourself, but here's one of the most popular ways to work out:<br>
                    PPL (Push Pull Legs) is a 7-day program split that determines what body part you exercise on a specific day. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monday: Push (chest, shoulders, and triceps)</li>
                    <li>Tuesday: Pull (back and biceps)</li>
                    <li>Wednesday: Legs</li>
                    <li>Thursday: Rest</li>
                    <li>Friday: Push</li>
                    <li>Saturday: Pull</li>
